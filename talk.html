# You need a website
???
* what can be a website?
* we assume you want to have something public on the internet
---
# Chapter 0 - YAGNI
Github pages FTW!
???
* Maybe static generator is enough?
* For a website that is updated every hour it is still good enough
---
# Chapter 1 - Data
Do you actually need a DB?
???
* it is assumed as default in most tutorials
* maybe just a `json` file is enough? Or a python dict?
---
# RDBMS
There is no silver bullet
???
* Again considered default
* good for generic data but often overkill
* SQLite can carry you a long way
* maybe a cloud hosted DB instead like xata, firebase?
---
# Queries, not data
Think about what you want to do, not what the data *is*.
