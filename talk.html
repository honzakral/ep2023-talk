# From idea to web
Friendly introduction into DevOps.

.footnote[[@flaper87](https://twitter.com/flaper87) / [@honzakral](https://twitter.com/honzakral)]
???
* We will talk about tools and show examples
* these re my opinions and what works for me
* remember *why* I say you should do things a certain way as opposed to *what* you should do
---
# You need a website
???
* what can be a website?
* we assume you want to have something public on the internet
* you can pay a few $$/month
* this is a start of a long term project
* usually you start with a template, here we learn how to build it so you understand the components
---
# Chapter 0 - YAGNI
Github pages FTW!
???
* Maybe static generator is enough?
* For a website that is updated every hour it is still good enough
---
# Chapter 1 - Code
Just use Django
???
* easy to start with
* lots of resources
---

.left-column[
# Local Development
]
.right-column[
### Dependencies

* `Poetry` for Python
]
???
Many options, this one works and does the right thing - dependency pinning, pruning, ...
--
.right-column[
### Configuration

* Env variables in production
* `os.environ.get("DATABASE_HOST", "localhost")`
]
???
Default to localhost to ease development (not for DEBUG)

--
.right-column[
### Tools

* `pre-commit` to keep you honest
* Tests to speed up development
* `pytest` for tests (with `pytest-django`)
]
???
automate everything, don't spend time on decisions
`black`, `isort`, `flake8`, ...
--
.right-column[
### CI

* replicate everything on Github
* Actions running `pre-commit` and your tests
]
???
frees your mind from thingking whether everything is in order
---
class: inverse
# GitHub Action - pre-commit
```yaml
name: pre-commit

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.0
```

class: inverse
# GitHub Action - pytest
```yaml
  pytest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15-alpine
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: s3cr3t
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    - run: python -m pip install poetry
    - run: poetry install --with dev
    - run: poetry run pytest
```

# All this before first line of Application code
???
* You never want to think about this again
* you want to be sure these things work and keep working
---
# Chapter 2 - Data
Do you actually need a DB?
???
* it is assumed as default in most tutorials
* maybe just a `yaml` file is enough? Or a python dict?
---
# RDBMS ?
There is no silver bullet
???
* Again considered default
* good for generic data but often overkill
* SQLite can carry you a long way
* maybe a cloud hosted DB instead like xata, firebase?
---
# Queries, not data
Think about what you want to do, not what the data *is*.
???
* both for picking a DB and creating a schema
---
# Run dependencies in Docker
Dependencies only!
???
* `docker-compose` to configure ports etc
* do not run python in docker
* run python manually!
---
layout: false
class: inverse
# Docker Compose - Dependencies
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=my_app
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=s3cr3t
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
```
???
* Everything you need, no need to install or manage state

# Chapter 3 - Going live!
Time to deploy
???
* Now things work locally and we have put measure in plce for them to *keep* working
* time to share our app

---
layout: false
.left-column[
# Infrastructure
...as code!
]
.right-column[
### Use Code to provision

* Terraform FTW
* OK to run manually
* Iterate like with code
]
???
never click in UI as that is wasted efforr
you need to be able to iterate
assume clean slate
DNS, google project, cloud run, ...
--
.right-column[
### Use Services

* RDS/Cloud SQL for RDBMS
* S3/GCS for static files
]
???
you want to run your app, not a database, not infrastructure

outsource that stuff
--
.right-column[
### Code for deployment

* `Dockerfile`
* CloudRun/ECS
]
???
Add dockerfile to control your environmnet
then use a service that can run a docker container
--
.right-column[
### Secrets

* Cloud Secret Manager
]
???
Make sure no secret is ever in any file, let alone in git!

# Terraform - Basic Infrastructure
```hcl
resource "google_project" "my_app" {
  name       = "My App"

  project          = google_project.my_app.id
  name             = "prod-db"
  database_version = "POSTGRES_15"
  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
  }
}
```
???
* TF apply will create everything in the right order
* to change, change code and run tf apply
* to delete, remove from code and run tf apply
---
# Terraform - DB User
```hcl
resource "random_password" "db_password" { length = 32 }

resource "google_secret_manager_secret" "db_password" {
  project   = google_project.my_app.id
  secret_id = "db-pasword"
}

resource "google_secret_manager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret      = google_secret_manager_secret.db_password.id
  secret_data = random_pasword.db_password.result
}

resource "google_sql_user" "db_user" {
  name     = "my_app"
  instance = google_sql_database_instance.prod_db.name
  password = random_pasword.db_password.result
}
```
???
* we create a user with a random password that we will never see!

# `deploy.sh`
**One** command to rule them all
???
* Build image
* upload to registry
* deploy to ecs/cloudrun
---
# Staging Environment
Resources in Terraform, flag for `deploy.sh`
---
# YAGNI 2.0 - k8s edition
Back away slowly and maintain eye contact
---
# Continuous Delivery
Automate what can be automated
???
* when adding another person
* recreate deploy.sh in GH actions
* use GH secrets for credentials

### Backups!

* untested backup doesn't count!
* rely on your cloud provider

### Monitoring

* Simple uptime monitoring is enough (tm)

.right-column[
### Debugging

* Error reporting
* APM

# You are Live!
And equipped to stay there!
???
* This was a setup from 0 to a great setup but not a finished one
* we skipped things and oversimplified others
* but we can not get there iteratively!
