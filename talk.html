# You need a website
???
* what can be a website?
* we assume you want to have something public on the internet
* you can pay a few $$/month
---
# Chapter 0 - YAGNI
Github pages FTW!
???
* Maybe static generator is enough?
* For a website that is updated every hour it is still good enough
---
# Chapter 1 - Code
Just use Django
???
* easy to start with
* lots of resources
---

### Configuration

* `.env` file (`.gitignore`d!)

# Chapter 2 - Data
Do you actually need a DB?
???
* it is assumed as default in most tutorials
* maybe just a `yaml` file is enough? Or a python dict?
---
# RDBMS ?
There is no silver bullet
???
* Again considered default
* good for generic data but often overkill
* SQLite can carry you a long way
* maybe a cloud hosted DB instead like xata, firebase?
---
# Queries, not data
Think about what you want to do, not what the data *is*.
???
* both for picking a DB and creating a schema
---
# Run dependencies in Docker
Dependencies only!
???
* `docker-compose` to configure ports etc
* do not run python in docker
* run python manually!
---
# Chapter 3 - Going live!
Time to deploy

---
layout: false

### Code for deployment

* `Dockerfile`
* `settings.py`
* Registry
* CloudRun/ECS

.right-column[
### Use Services

* RDS/Cloud SQL for RDBMS
* S3/GCS for static files
]
--
.right-column[
### Use Code to provision

* Terraform FTW
* OK to run manually
* Iterate like with code
]
???
* assume clean slate
* DNS, google project, cloud run, ...

### Secrets

* Cloud Secret Manager

# `deploy.sh`
**One** command to rule them all
???
* Build image
* upload to registry
* deploy to ecs/cloudrun
---
# Staging Environment
Resources in Terraform, flag for `deploy.sh`
---
# YAGNI 2.0 - k8s edition
Back away slowly and maintain eye contact
---
# Continuous Delivery
Automate what can be automated
???
* when adding another person
* recreate deploy.sh in GH actions
* use GH secrets for credentials
