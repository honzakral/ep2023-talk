# From idea to web
Friendly introduction into DevOps.

.footnote[[@flaper87](https://twitter.com/flaper87) / [@honzakral](https://twitter.com/honzakral)]
???
* Flavio sends his regards, but he couldn't make it :(
* We will talk about how to create your app, focusing on tools for deployment
* these re my opinions and what works for me
* remember *why* I say you should do things a certain way as opposed to *what* you should do
---
# You need a website
???
* we assume you want to have something public on the internet
* you can pay a few $$/month
* this is a start of a long term project
* usually you start with a template, here we learn how to build it so you understand the components
---
# Disclaimers apply
None of this is **easy**
???
* This is not the "easy" way to do things
* this talk is more about the right way to do it
---
# Chapter 0 - YAGNI
Github pages FTW!
???
* Maybe static generator is enough?
* For a website that is updated every hour it is still good enough
---
# Chapter 1 - Code
Just use Django
???
* easy to start with
* lots of resources
---

# Local Development
]
.right-column[
### Dependencies

* `Poetry` for Python
]
???
Many options, this one works and does the right thing - dependency pinning, pruning, ...
--
.right-column[
### Configuration

* Env variables in production
* `os.environ.get("DATABASE_HOST", "localhost")`
]
???
Default to localhost to ease development (not for DEBUG)

--
.right-column[
### Tools

* `pre-commit` to keep you honest
* Tests to speed up development
* `pytest` for tests (with `pytest-django`)
]
???
automate everything, don't spend time on decisions
`black`, `isort`, `flake8`, ...
--
.right-column[
### CI

* replicate everything on Github
* Actions running `pre-commit` and your tests
]
???
frees your mind from thingking whether everything is in order
---

    steps:

          POSTGRES_USER=my_app
          POSTGRES_DATABASE=my_app
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: s3cr3t
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    - run: python -m pip install poetry
    - run: poetry install --with dev
    - run: poetry run pytest

# All this before first line of Application code
???
* You never want to think about this again
* you want to be sure these things work and keep working
---
# Chapter 2 - Data
Do you actually need a DB?
???
* it is assumed as default in most tutorials
  * I even assumed in the GH action example
* maybe just a `yaml` file is enough? Or a python dict?
---
# RDBMS ?
There is no silver bullet
???
* Again considered default
* good for generic data but often overkill
* SQLite can carry you a long way
* maybe a cloud hosted service instead?
* consider redis, elasticsearch, or mongo
---
# Queries, not data
Think about what you want to **do**, not what the data **is**.
???
* both for picking a DB and creating a schema once you commit
---
# Run dependencies in Docker
Dependencies only!
???
* `docker-compose` to configure ports etc
* do not run python in docker
* run python manually!
---
layout: false
class: inverse
# Docker Compose - Dependencies
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=my_app
      - POSTGRES_DATABASE=my_app
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=s3cr3t
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
```
???
* Everything you need, no need to install or manage state
* Allows you to run tests on same system as production
* Makes sure you don't rely on stale state :)

# Chapter 3 - Going live!
Time to deploy
???
* now code...
* Now things work locally and we have put measure in place for them to *keep* working
* time to share our app with the world

---
layout: false
.left-column[
# Infrastructure
...as code!
]
.right-column[
### Use Code to provision

* Terraform FTW
* OK to run manually
* Iterate like with code
]
???
never click in UI as that is wasted efforr

just as easy to figure out as the UI but repeatable and iterable!!

assume clean slate
DNS, google project, cloud run, ...
--
.right-column[
### Use Services

* RDS/Cloud SQL for RDBMS
* S3/GCS for static files
]
???
you want to run your app, not a database, not infrastructure

outsource that stuff
--
.right-column[
### Code for deployment

* `Dockerfile`
* CloudRun/ECS
]
???
Add dockerfile to control your environmnet
then use a service that can run a docker container
--
.right-column[
### Secrets

* Cloud Secret Manager
]
???
Make sure no secret is ever in any file, let alone in git!

* TF apply will create everything in the right order
* to change, change code and run tf apply
* to delete, remove from code and run tf apply

# Terraform - DB User

# Terraform - Cloud Run
```terraform

  location = "eu-west2"

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "gcr.io/my-app/myimage"
        env {
          name  = "DATABASE_HOST"
          value = google_sql_database_instance.prod_db.private_ip_address
        }
        env {
          name = "DATABASE_PASSWORD"
          value_from {
            secret_key_ref {
              name = google_secret_manager_secret.db_passwword.name
              key  = "latest"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
???
We just refer to the secret we created and it will be set as env variable

no need for copy paste

# Staging Environment
Resources in Terraform, flag for `deploy.sh`

Duplicate the terrafor, or better yet, parametrize!

Parametrize the deploy.sh as well
---
# YAGNI 2.0 - k8s edition
Back away slowly and maintain eye contact
???
Just so we are clear, lot of people will tell you about kubernetes...

... don't listen to them

Kubernetes is used to build stuff we are using in this talk and in most projects. It is way too low level
---
# Continuous Delivery
Automate what can be automated
???
* when adding another person
* recreate deploy.sh in GH actions
* use GH secrets for credentials

# You are Live!
And equipped to stay there!
???
* This was a setup from 0 to a great setup but not a finished one
* we skipped things and oversimplified others
* but we can now get there iteratively!
* we can also replicate the entrie thing easily for next project and/or environment

* first time I did this, as an experienced engineer but devops newbie, it took me a week, and it made me smile every time I ran deploy.sh for years after
